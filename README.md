- Run 'cmake ..' in the 'build' directory to generate the build scripts for your system.
- 'cmake --build .' to compile the library
- The compiled library can be found under the directory 'build/src/main/c'

## Compiling the Java library

### Using Buildr
- Install [Buildr](http://buildr.apache.org)
- Run 'buildr package test=false' in the root of the project
- The compiled Java library can be found under the 'target' directory

### Using Maven
- Install [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
- Run 'mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true package' in the root of the project
